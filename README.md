### Hi there 👋

I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at UFCG and developer/researcher at LSD 🚀 having an experience of building CLI applications with golang and some other cool things like containers, docker and kubenetes

🔭 I’m currently working on study and improve the [beeFS](http://ce-resd.facom.ufms.br/sbrc/2010/074.pdf) system.

🌱 I’m currently learning golang and concurrent programming
